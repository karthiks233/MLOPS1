# MyMLOps

Setting up MLOps pipelines

1. Created app.py - Which calculates over 10 different math functions(Addtional 6 are sin, cosine, tan, log, exponential, square root)

Note:
The range of input is limited as constrained by the various math functions here, for example a: 0, b: 0 would cause zero division error and log error and higher values like a:180 b:180 can cause math range error.

However, values like a: [1,90] and b: [1,90] should work

2. Setup Pytest and Unittest

Built two seperate files names py_test.py and unit_test.py to perform Pytest and Unittest

3. Setup Github Actions

Setup github actions workflows to capture code changes to github repository and automate test workflows.
